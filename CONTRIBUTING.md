## I Have a Question

> If you want to ask a question, we assume that you have read the available Documentation.

Before you ask a question, it is best to search for existing Issues that might help you. In case you have found a suitable issue and still need clarification, you can write your question in this issue. It is also advisable to search the internet for answers first.

## I Want To Contribute

### Reporting Bugs

-   **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/haroldalan/spotify-karaoke/issues).
-   If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/haroldalan/spotify-karaoke/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

### Suggesting Enhancements

-   **Perform a Search** to see if the enhancement has already been suggested. If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.
-   **Open a New Issue** which describes the feature you would like to see, why you need it, and how it should work.
