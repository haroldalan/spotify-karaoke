# Spotify Karaoke

**Spotify Karaoke** is a browser extension that enhances your Spotify Web Player experience by adding **Romanized** and **Translated** lyrics options. (Only for Lyrics offered by Spotify. This extension does not provide lyrics for songs that do not have lyrics on Spotify. Yet!)

## Features

-   **Original Lyrics**: View lyrics as provided by Spotify.
-   **Romanized Lyrics**: Automatically transliterate lyrics into Roman characters (great for K-Pop, J-Pop, etc.).
-   **Translated Lyrics**: Translate lyrics into 100+ languages using Google Translate.
-   **Lyrics Caching**: Cache Translated Lyrics to improve performance and reduce API calls.
-   **Sleek Design**: A dark-themed component that blends perfectly with Spotify's native UI.
